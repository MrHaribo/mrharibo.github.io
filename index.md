# MicroNet Documentation

MicroNet is a open source framework designed to developing complex online games. MicroNet uses a **Microservice** driven design approach to achieve a scalable and evolvable application design. MicroNet applications are generally developed in *Java* but also possible to integrate other languages into a MicroNet application using the **MicroNet Composition** concepts. MicroNet Composition makes it possible to integrate MicroNet into a Game Engine like for example *Unity3D*.

The MicroNet **Core Framework** provides components to abstract the low level aspects *networking*, *serialization*, and *persistence* and present them to the developer in a convenient way. On top of MicroNet's low level functionality the framework provides high level game finctionality in the form of a **Service Catalog** which allows the developer to integrate often required functionality like user management, matchmaking, items, shops, or vehicles quickly into a game project. 

The **MicroNet Tools** are a plug-in collection for the *Eclipse IDE*. The plug-ins provide a convenient way to develop the overall application behaviour of an application that is composed from multiple Microservices.
