# MicroNet Documentation

MicroNet is a open source framework to assist in developing complex online games. MicroNet is realized using a Microservice architecture which makes for a very scalable and evolvable application design.

The framework provides components to abstract the low level aspects networking, serialization, and persistence and present them to the developer in a convenient way. On top of MicroNet's low level functionality the framework provides high level game finctionality in the form of a ServiceCatalog which allows the developer to integrate often required functionality like user management, matchmaking, items, shops, or vehicles quickly into a game project. MicroNet is developed in Java but also other languages can also be integrated in a MicroNet application.

The MicroNet Tools are a plug-in collection for the Eclipse IDE. The plug-ins provide a convenient way to develop the overall application behaviour of an application that is composed from multiple Microservices.
