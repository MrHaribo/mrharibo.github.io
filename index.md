# MicroNet Documentation

MicroNet is a open source framework designed for developing complex online games. MicroNet uses a **Microservice** driven design approach to achieve a scalable and evolvable application design. MicroNet applications are generally developed in *Java* but it is also possible to integrate other languages into a MicroNet application using the **MicroNet Composition** concepts. MicroNet Composition makes it possible to integrate MicroNet into a Game Engine e.g. *Unity3D*.

The MicroNet **Core Framework** provides components to abstract the low level aspects: *networking*, *serialization*, and *persistence*. Presenting them to the developer in a convenient way. On top of MicroNet's low level functionality the framework provides high level game functionality in the form of a **Service Catalog** which allows the developer to quickly integrate often required functionality e.g. user management, matchmaking, items, shops, or vehicles into a game project. 

The **MicroNet Tools** are a plug-in collection for the *Eclipse IDE*. The plug-ins provide a convenient way to develop the overall application behaviour of an application that is composed of multiple Microservices.
