## Installation

MicroNet itself does not require any installation but it requires both a **Docker Engine** and an **Eclipse IDE** installation on the developers host. MicroNet was developed with Microsoft Windows but is to work also in Linux, and MacOS. The MicroNet Tools however where only tested in Windows. 

### Docker Installation

The most convenient way to install docker on a developer's computer is by using the **Docker Desktop** version which is available for *MacOS* and *Microsoft Windows 10*. On Linux a native docker installation can be used.  

#### Windows
On Windows a Windows Pro version is required to use Docker Desktop because it requires **HyperV** to be enabled which is not possible on Windows Home Editions. If you have Windows 10, enable **HyperV** as explained in the Windows Documentation [Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v). Afterwards download and install the appropriate **Docker Desktop** client which can be found on the [Official Docker Installation Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

If you don't have Windows 10 Pro the best alternative solution is to use the [Docker Toolbox](#docker-toolbox) as explained [below](#docker-toolbox). In any case test your docker installation using the for example the `docker info` command.

#### Linux

On Linux use the appropriate installation guide for your opperating system: 
[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), 
[Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/), 
[CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/centos/), or
[Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/fedora/).
